# Post-Scam-Checklist
A checklist for when you realize you've just fallen victim to a tech support scam, or something like it.

## Backstory

A family member recently fell victim to a tech support scam. They tried to go to, I think, amazoncom-dot-com, which redirects a bunch of potential places including to tech support scams. This family member says a ton of windows popped up effectively locking up the computer, and emploring them to call microsoft at some provided number. The person on the other end coached them through renewing some kind of subscription, which involved a lot of unsupervised remote access, writing a check, and sending them an image of the front. 

The exact playbook of the scam is unclear to me - hopefully it ends at depositing a big check. We have to assume it's much worse, so have a look at "checklist.md" if you need to triage this situaiton for yourself.
